Researched numerous hotel options in Marrakesh and by far, Riad Ilayka was the best in terms of the exceptional quality of the accommodations, phenomenal level of service and ideal location. As someone who has traveled to over 200 countries, the extremely high level of customer service we enjoyed during our stay really stood out in my mind. I reached out to the hotel prior to my arrival to assist with booking a COVID test and Nadia went above and beyond to research options, schedule my appointment and ensure I received my results even after I had checked out. They truly take care of all of you and are highly attentive to your needs. The Riad is perfectly located in the old medina and just steps away from the famous square. Even though you’re steps away from the center of action, the Riad is located in a small side street that provides peace and quiet and was a perfect oasis. Each room is unique and decorated beautifully in a traditional style and you really feel that you’re having an authentic experience. There’s a wonderful roof top with a hot tub and fantastic views – the perfect place to unwind after a day of sightseeing and activities. I can’t emphasize enough how attentive and caring the staff was – ready to accommodate your every need. The courtyard is just beautiful and a lovely place to have breakfast, tea and just relax. While there are a multitude of options available in Marrakesh, guarantee a wonderful stay for yourself by booking at Riad Ilayka – you will truly be impressed and your expectations will be exceeded! Thank you for an experience of a lifetime!',\n",

The Riad is found down a winding alley and upon entering you are immediately invited in to a beautiful calm courtyard with trees, soft music playing and birds singing all around you. You are welcomed with mint tea and homemade biscuits then shown to your room and wow was my first reaction, dark wood panelling adorns the walls and although the decor is dark it is very luxurious and romantic. The terrace upstairs has seating, sunbeds, a little pool which unfortunately we never tried and up some further stairs is a little pergola with more seating and views across the rooftops of the city. Breakfast is served around the courtyard and very generous with freshly squeezed juices { different ones each day!}, tea or coffee, eggs, yoghurt and many different breads and cakes. But without a doubt the thing that makes this Riad special are the staff, the service is outstanding. Their warmth, friendliness and genuine wish to help in any way they can to make your holiday memorable is something I will never forget. We were not only given advice on how to get to places of interest we were actually chaperoned on a couple of occasions. I want to thank everyone at Riad Ilayka for making our first trip to Marrakech totally unforgettable and ensuring we will come again. xxx',\n",

It's basically a small mansion with a few rooms. And we did not expect the AMAZING luxury service that we got at Riad Ilayka! Mohammed the manager was always so helpful with whatever we asked. He set us up with a private cooking class at the Riad! We then had our meal served to us for dinner in a beautiful presentation! Our room was always clean when we got back from site seeing and you can tell they take great pride in keeping the Riad itself in amazing condition. We made friends with a few others staying at the Riad and truly felt as if the staff were family. I highly recommend Riad Ilayka and will be back soon to visit!\",\n",

       "   'text': 'At Riad Ilyaka we felt at home in the otherwise bustling Médina. The entire staff from the management team to the concierge gentlemen are committed to providing a comfortable stay. It is clear that the team prides itself on offering a 360-degree experience. Azeddine was the highlight for us. He is a gentle-soul with a warm smile who goes the extra mile without expecting anything in return. This is superb service. We recommend organizing excursions, tours or inquiring at the Riad, as they validate legitimacy. The best part about staying in a Riad is the authentic cultural experience. You do have take a few turns in the alleyways to find the entrance, but the staff offers to help navigate until you feel comfortable with the route. At no point did we ever feel unsafe. There is only one way in and out, with a bolted door which the staff controls. At night there is a security guard outside a hostel in the alleyway which also keeps an eye on any traffic. The rooftop is also locked down late at night for extra security. A safe is provided in the room. On our last evening, the staff organized a private cooking class. We had so much fun shopping in the market hall and picking the spices. The chefs talked us through every step so that we can recreate the dishes at home. The tagine we made was the best we had!',\n",

       "   'text': 'L’accueil, Nadia la propriétaire et toute l’équipe qui veille sur nous étaient juste parfaits. Toujours présents quand on a besoin mais une présence discrète. Vous pouvez vous fier les yeux fermés à toutes les recommandations qu’ils pourront vous faire. Le Ryad est sublime et dans le vrai goût de ce qu’on attend à Marrakech. Beaux matériaux, agréable patio et très belle décoration. De nombreuses terrasses et des espaces de tranquillité un peu partout. Vue imprenable sur l’Atlas, les toits de la médina. Le soir, niché dans le petit kiosque surplombant la terrasse, la frénésie de la place Jemaa El Fna se laisse deviner avec les bruits des tambourins au loin. Magique. L’emplacement est juste parfait. Le meilleur quartier de la Médina : assez près de la place mais suffisamment loin pour profiter des souks plus typiques. Pour finir, la cuisine est délicieuse. Le petit déjeuner est très copieux et dans la tradition marocaine, le tout servi avec les oiseaux sous les orangers. Le soir, le tajine et le couscous de Alima sont à tomber parterre, sans parler des entrées, briouates et desserts! (prévoyez quand même une petite balade dans les souks pour la digestion! D’autant plus que le quartier est très agréable lorsque les boutiques commencent à se vider et se fermer). For the one who doesn’t speak french, as a frequent traveller to Marrakech, please don’t hesitate to book this wonderful Ryad, clearly one of the best. Everything is perfect. Un grand merci à Nadia, Abdul, Azzedine, Mohamed, Reda, Alima et toutes filles de l’ombre qui prennent soin du Ryad ainsi que le jardinier! A très vite! Roger-Alexandre et Maria',\n",

El personal atentos, encantadores y se desviven para que sus clientes estuvieran a gusto. El Riad es limpio, las habitaciones muy bonitas y decoradas con mucho gusto, las camas súper cómodas, el baño precioso y no faltaba detalle. La wifi funcionaba muy bien en todo el Riad, el desayuno completo. Tuvieron un súper detalle con mi mujer por su cumpleaños. Os recomiendo cenar o comer en el Riad. Es riquísimo.

Ontbijt is super uitgebreid met verse streekproducten. Diner is ook een aanrader, er wordt een goed 3 gangen diner verzorgd op aanvraag (lokale gerechten). Wel moet je dit op tijd aangeven, zodat de kok tijdig verse producten kan inkopen en zich kan voorbereiden. Bij het Riad kun je ook de transfer regelen naar de luchthaven en excursies boeken, wij hebben dit gedaan en is zeker aan te bevelen.
