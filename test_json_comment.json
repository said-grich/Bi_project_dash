Researched numerous hotel options in Marrakesh and by far, Riad Ilayka was the best in terms of the exceptional quality of the accommodations, phenomenal level of service and ideal location. As someone who has traveled to over 200 countries, the extremely high level of customer service we enjoyed during our stay really stood out in my mind. I reached out to the hotel prior to my arrival to assist with booking a COVID test and Nadia went above and beyond to research options, schedule my appointment and ensure I received my results even after I had checked out. They truly take care of all of you and are highly attentive to your needs. The Riad is perfectly located in the old medina and just steps away from the famous square. Even though you\u2019re steps away from the center of action, the Riad is located in a small side street that provides peace and quiet and was a perfect oasis. Each room is unique and decorated beautifully in a traditional style and you really feel that you\u2019re having an authentic experience. There\u2019s a wonderful roof top with a hot tub and fantastic views \u2013 the perfect place to unwind after a day of sightseeing and activities. I can\u2019t emphasize enough how attentive and caring the staff was \u2013 ready to accommodate your every need. The courtyard is just beautiful and a lovely place to have breakfast, tea and just relax. While there are a multitude of options available in Marrakesh, guarantee a wonderful stay for yourself by booking at Riad Ilayka \u2013 you will truly be impressed and your expectations will be exceeded! Thank you for an experience of a lifetime!",

The Riad is found down a winding alley and upon entering you are immediately invited in to a beautiful calm courtyard with trees, soft music playing and birds singing all around you. You are welcomed with mint tea and homemade biscuits then shown to your room and wow was my first reaction, dark wood panelling adorns the walls and although the decor is dark it is very luxurious and romantic. The terrace upstairs has seating, sunbeds, a little pool which unfortunately we never tried and up some further stairs is a little pergola with more seating and views across the rooftops of the city. Breakfast is served around the courtyard and very generous with freshly squeezed juices { different ones each day!}, tea or coffee, eggs, yoghurt and many different breads and cakes. But without a doubt the thing that makes this Riad special are the staff, the service is outstanding. Their warmth, friendliness and genuine wish to help in any way they can to make your holiday memorable is something I will never forget. We were not only given advice on how to get to places of interest we were actually chaperoned on a couple of occasions. I want to thank everyone at Riad Ilayka for making our first trip to Marrakech totally unforgettable and ensuring we will come again. xxx",

There is only one way in and out, with a bolted door which the staff controls. At night there is a security guard outside a hostel in the alleyway which also keeps an eye on any traffic. The rooftop is also locked down late at night for extra security. A safe is provided in the room. On our last evening, the staff organized a private cooking class.

Le Ryad est sublime et dans le vrai go\u00fbt de ce qu\u2019on attend \u00e0 Marrakech. Beaux mat\u00e9riaux, agr\u00e9able patio et tr\u00e8s belle d\u00e9coration. De nombreuses terrasses et des espaces de tranquillit\u00e9 un peu partout. Vue imprenable sur l\u2019Atlas, les toits de la m\u00e9dina. Le soir, nich\u00e9 dans le petit kiosque surplombant la terrasse, la fr\u00e9n\u00e9sie de la place Jemaa El Fna se laisse deviner avec les bruits des tambourins au loin. Magique. L\u2019emplacement est juste parfait. Le meilleur quartier de la M\u00e9dina : assez pr\u00e8s de la place mais suffisamment loin pour profiter des souks plus typiques. Pour finir, la cuisine est d\u00e9licieuse. Le petit d\u00e9jeuner est tr\u00e8s copieux et dans la tradition marocaine, le tout servi avec les oiseaux sous les orangers. Le soir, le tajine et le couscous de Alima sont \u00e0 tomber parterre, sans parler des entr\u00e9es, briouates et desserts! (pr\u00e9voyez quand m\u00eame une petite balade dans les souks pour la digestion! D\u2019autant plus que le quartier est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able lorsque les boutiques commencent \u00e0 se vider et se fermer). For the one who doesn\u2019t speak french, as a frequent traveller to Marrakech, please don\u2019t hesitate to book this wonderful Ryad, clearly one of the best. Everything is perfect. Un grand merci \u00e0 Nadia, Abdul, Azzedine, Mohamed, Reda, Alima et toutes filles de l\u2019ombre qui prennent soin du Ryad ainsi que le jardinier! A tr\u00e8s vite! Roger-Alexandre et Maria",

Dakterras is heerlijk met 6 grote ligstoelen en diverse zitjes. Uitzicht is fantastisch. Er is een waterbad waar je in kunt zitten met maximaal 3 personen, maar dit stelt weinig voor. Ontbijt is super uitgebreid met verse streekproducten. Diner is ook een aanrader, er wordt een goed 3 gangen diner verzorgd op aanvraag (lokale gerechten). Wel moet je dit op tijd aangeven, zodat de kok tijdig verse producten kan inkopen en zich kan voorbereiden. Bij het Riad kun je ook de transfer regelen naar de luchthaven en excursies boeken, wij hebben dit gedaan en is zeker aan te bevelen. Kortom een top Riad met uiterst vriendelijk personeel die het jou echt naar de zin wil maken.",
